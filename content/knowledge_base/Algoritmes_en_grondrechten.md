### Summary

The rise of automated decision-making (ADM) leads to new constitutional challenges. Techniques like recommender systems and risk-based sampling impact human autonomy. Statistical biases could lead to unequal treatment. 

More analysis is needed to address such constitutional challenges in an adequate manner. In the context of the Dutch legal system, this book discusses the impact of digital technology on fundametal rights, such as freedom rights, equality rights, privacy rights and procedural rights. 

The book provides an adequate and systemic overview of constitutional challenges in relation to one of the most urgent current societal issues. The book is therefore relevant for everyone who is involved with ADM from all disciplines.
