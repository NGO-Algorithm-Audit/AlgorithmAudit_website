###### **Authors: Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth**

Books on ethics and algorithms are mushrooming. In this rapidly growing domain, _The Ethical Algorithm_ is a must-read for both technical and non-technical readers.

From various disciplines the book collects cutting-edge thinking how ethics and algorithms should co-exist. Theoretical concepts as _k_-anonymity, _p_-hacking and differential privacy are explained clearly through comprehensible and illustrated examples. At the start of the book, a sorting algorithm is discussed step-by-step to give non-technical readers a taste what algorithms are about.

The authors (two heavyweight researchers in theoretical computer science) present a broad notion of fair algorithms. Main parts of the book are elaborate on sociological concepts. For example: users often play with algorithms for their own benefit. The authors explain why remedies can be found both in the technological and non-technological domain. In the same holistic manner, delicate topics that emerge in ethics,  'Should certain protected variables  be included in or excluded from algorithmic tools?’, are treated with care. In such, _The Ethical Algorithm_ takes a distinguished stance on sociological, technical and political ramifications that emerge while discussing analogue and digital notions of fairness.

Although the linkage between the two main parts of the book (algorithmic privacy and algorithmic fairness) remains unexplained, the concepts discussed in both parts are compelling. For instance the concept of _Pareto frontiers_. Those frontiers constitute sets of “reasonable” choices for the trade-off between accuracy and fairness of algorithmic models. Pareto frontiers make tradeoffs between accuracy and fairness as quantitative as possible, but no more so. The numeric curves are “necessarily silent about which point we should choose along the frontier, because that is a matter of judgment about the relative importance of accuracy and fairness”. Kearns and Roth argue that “we must accept this bargain for strong fairness guarantees”.

Why not to avoid/use algorithms altogether? _The_ _Ethical Algorithm_ presents solid answers on fundamental questions:

> “Trade-offs between how fair decision-making models are and how accurate they are have always been implicitly present in human decision-making; the data centric, algorithmic era has just brought them to the fore and encouraged us to reason about them more precisely.”

Guided by books of this quality, the daunting task to realize a fair digital future becomes a little bit less complicated.
