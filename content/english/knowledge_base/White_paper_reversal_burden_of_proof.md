summary: First white paper on the reversal of Algorithm Audit on  the burden of proof in the context of (semi-)automated decision-making

---
Algorithm Audit has published its first white paperðŸ¥‡ Reversing the burden of proof is a promising approach to protect against discrimination in the context of (semi-)automated decision-making (ADM). Yet to make it feasible we need to overcome some hurdles.

This is what we advise policy makers across the EU to facilitate reversing the burden of proof and improve legal protection for (semi-)ADM:

<span style="font-size: 25px;">ðŸ‘€</span> Improve the visibility of algorithms by enforcing information obligations for using ADM;

<span style="font-size: 25px;">ðŸ¤³</span>Establish national hotlines where potentially discriminatory (semi-)ADM can be reported and where litigation support can be provided;

<span style="font-size: 25px;">ðŸ“š</span>Train staff of courts, parliament, ministries, and other authorities in interpreting (semi-)ADM qualitatively. 

We'd love to hear your thoughts!

###### **Summary**

This document formulates actionable suggestions to improve legal protection for citizens and consumers in the European Union in the context for (semi-)automated decision-making (ADM). The suggestions in this document are linked to an existing concept in EU non- discrimination law: the reversal of the burden of proof.
