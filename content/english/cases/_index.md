{{< cases "Ethical risk assessment tool" "The composition of the audit commission for this case is made publicly available once the final advice of the commission is published.">}}
This project sheds light into pressing ethical issues which arise in risk assessment tools. When should characteristics of citizens and customers be considered as protected variables? When do variables act as proxies for protected characteristics? 

For specific algorithms, the Algorithm Audit Foundation brings together an independent, professional and diverse audit commission that examines the used methodology and data processing methods to assess bias. Case by case, the audit commission formulates a context-sensitive recommendation regarding the identified ethical concerns. Conclusions are shared and provide developers with techno-ethical best practices to realize algorithmic fairness.
