### Ethical risk assessment tool 

What are fair algorithms? How to make autonomous decision making more fair? This project sheds light into pressing ethical issues which arise in risk assessment tools. When should characteristics of citizens and customers be considered as protected variables? When do variables act as proxies for protected characteristics? For specific algorithms, the Algorithm Audit Foundation brings together an independent, professional and diverse audit commission that examines the used methodology and data processing methods to assess bias. Case by case, the audit commission formulates a context-sensitive recommendation regarding the identified ethical concerns. Conclusions are shared and provide developers with techno-ethical best practices to realize algorithmic fairness.
