    Organization-wide algorithm management policy requires pragmatic frameworks.
    A risk-oriented approach is often leading here. This is in line with
    national and international legislation for algorithms, such as the AI
    ​​Regulation. Below you will find an example of an algorithm scorecard for
    public sector organizations. Based on this scorecard, algorithms can be
    classified as high, medium or low risk.
