{{< container_open title="Synthetic data generation – What is it?" icon="fas fa-file" id="info" >}}

Garbage in, garbage out: When auditing semi-automated decision-making processes, one of the most immediate questions is the representativeness of the source data. However, privacy poses a hurdle to sharing data with external parties to assess the representativeness of the data. Absent access to source data means that stakeholders – such as people whose data is stored and independent experts – cannot scrutinize it for potential biases. Consequently, the evaluation of data used for semi-automated decision-making processes, and training of AI-systems, relies on a small group. If this evaluation process is not performed carefully, this can have severe downstream consequences for the decision-making processes that are using these data. This harms public trust in technology and in the organisations that deploy these digital methods.

Synthetic data generation (SDG) – the creation of artificial datasets mimicking the original dataset's statistical characteristics – emerges as a potential solution. SDG has the potential to extend the audience involved in assessing the representativeness of data. It is considered a safe approach for the wider release of privately held data, as it contains no identifiable trace of the personal data it was generated from.
