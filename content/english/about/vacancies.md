{{< accordion_item_open image="/images/logo/logo.svg" title="Responsible AI expert – AI Act standardization cohort" id="standardization" tag1="rolling applications" tag2="2-4 hours per week" tag3="voluntary" background_color="#ffffff" >}}

{{< button button_text="Apply for this function" button_link="#form" >}}

#### Summary

Would you like to contribute to shaping AI standards
for the common good? Become part of Algorithm Audit’s part-time voluntary cohort,
consisting of 5 international qualitative and quantitative responsible AI
experts. By joining, you will be registered on behalf of Algorithm Audit as a CEN-CENELEC
JTC21 expert, granting you direct involvement in working groups devising AI
standards at the European level. Participating in this cohort positions you to
become an AI Act expert towards the implementation of the Act in 2026. Besides,
it enables you to work together with cutting-edge not-for-profit international AI
auditing experts.

#### What is Algorithm Audit?

Algorithm Audit is a European knowledge platform for
AI bias testing and normative AI standards. We are a young, tech-savvy NGO working
on ethical issues that arise in real-world algorithms. We bring together
experts from various professional backgrounds to build bottom-up public
knowledge how to use AI in a responsible manner (see our case repository: https://algorithmaudit.eu/algoprudence/).
Besides, we develop, maintain and test open-source AI auditing tools. Check for
instance our synthetic data generation and bias detection tool cohorts (https://algorithmaudit.eu/about/teams/).

#### &#xA;Project activities

You will follow standardization activities in one of
the following working groups (WGs): WG2 Operational aspects (e.g., risk
management), WG3 Engineering aspects (e.g., data and bias) or WG4
Trustworthiness (e.g., fundamental rights). Within your chosen WG, your role
involves staying informed about ongoing standardization activities by reviewing
online materials and attending WG meetings. Depending on the distribution of
cohort members over the WGs, tasks can be divided. During the first 4 weeks of
the cohort, you will undergo together with fellow cohort members a concise online
standardization training to familiarize yourselves with using CEN-CENELEC’s
information system. After this, you will collaborate with Algorithm Audit’s AI
auditing experts to formulate written contributions for ongoing standardization
activities. Insights gained from Algorithm Audit’s bottom-up auditing work will
serve as input for top-down AI standards currently under development. Every 4-6
weeks, you will provide a brief summary of the WG’s recent progress to your
fellow cohort members.

#### &#xA;&#xA;What will you do as cohort team member?   

* Dedicate 2-4 hours per week from Apr-15 up to Dec-31st
  2024 on JTC21 standardization activities;
* As an AI expert, serve as a representative for Algorithm
  Audit within the international AI standardization community, showcasing
  Algorithm Audit as a European knowledge platform for AI bias testing and
  normative AI standards;
* Translate bottom-up AI auditing experiences into meaningful contributions to procedural and technical standards for AI, for instance hypothesis testing standards (t-tests, Z-tests, chi-square-tests etc.)
  for risk profiling algorithms, inclusion of stakeholder panels for qualitative
  interpretation of confusion matrix-based performance/fairness metrics (FPRs, FNRs
  etc.) and your own ideas. See also Algorithm Audit’s algoprudence case repository
  https://algorithmaudit.eu/algoprudence/;
* Coordinate your own work activities. Reading and writing activities can be scheduled at your convenience. Attendance at working group meetings may necessitate some planning, attendance can be coordinated with fellow cohort members;
* Share (bi)monthly updates with the standardization cohort;
* Become an expert in standards that will underpin the AI Act from 2026 onwards.

#### Candidate profile

* PhD or MSc degree in one of the following fields
  related to responsible AI: computer science, engineering, statistics,
  mathematics, ethics, philosophy, law, policy or social sciences with focus on digital society;
* Proven track record and ideally active
  participation in public discussions regarding responsible AI;
* Understanding of academic discussions concerning AI and its intersection
  with fundamental rights, explainability, human oversight, and/or risk management;
* Willing to contribute 2-4h per week, besides your day-to-day
  professional job, to build public knowledge for responsible algorithms;
* You can assure there is no conflict of interest
  between contributing to AI standards from a common good-perspective and your
  professional activities. If you are employed in industry, please provide
  further details on your motivation for participating in standardization endeavors and
  how you plan to address any potential conflicts;
* Available up to 31-12-2024 to contribute to participate
  in the cohort;
* Advantageous: Methodological expertise in hypothesis
  testing, unsupervised machine learning (specifically clustering) and
  statistical inference.

#### Our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion

We
encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply and join us in our mission
to build a European knowledge platform for AI bias testing
and normative AI standards. Algorithm Audit is committed to inclusion across race, gender, age,
religion, identity, and experience. We foster a multidisciplinary environment
where everyone, from any background, can do their best work. We actively seek
to include a diverse set of voices and perspectives in all aspects of our activities,
how we form cohorts, structure our leadership team, the advice we give and the
technical tools we deploy. Algorithm Audit’s commitment is reflected in its
core mission to strengthen more fair and less discriminatory deployment of AI
in all parts of society. We build and share public knowledge about
discriminatory bias and fostering equitable algorithms and methods for
data-analysis.
