{{< about_algorithm_audit "About Algorithm Audit" "In 2021, Algorithm Audit was founded on the idea that ethics in algorithmic methods urgently needs case-based experience and a bottom-up approach. We are registred as a Dutch nonprofit organization (stichting). Currently we are working on our first cases. In the near future we hope to contribute to the public debate by publishing white papers, opinion pieces and advice of our audit commissions about ethical algorithms.">}}
