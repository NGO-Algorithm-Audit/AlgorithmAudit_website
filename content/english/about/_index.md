{{< about_algorithm_audit "About Algorithm Audit" "In 2021, Algorithm Audit was founded on the idea that ethics in algorithmic methods urgently needs case-based experience and a bottom-up approach. We are registred as a Dutch nonprofit organization (stichting). Our main activity is to form independent audit commissions that give ethical advice on real-life algorithmic methods as used in the private and/or public sector. On top of that, Algorithm Audit facilitates a platform for multidisciplinary experts to engage in (inter)national automated decision-making policy development.">}}
