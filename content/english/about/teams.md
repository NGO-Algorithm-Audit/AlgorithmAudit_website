      content: >
        Bringing together experts and knowledge to foster the collective
        learning process on the responsible use of algorithms, see for instance
        our [AI policy observatory](/knowledge-platform/policy-observatory/),
        [white papers](/knowledge-platform/knowledge-base/) and
        [op-eds](/knowledge-platform/knowledge-base/).
    - subtitle: Normative advice commissions
      image: /images/about/commission.svg
      content: >
        Advising on ethical issues that arise in concrete algorithmic practice
        through deliberative and diverse normative advice commissions, resulting
        in [algoprudence](/algoprudence/).
    - subtitle: Technical tooling
      image: /images/about/technical-tools.svg
      content: >
        Implementing and testing technical tools to detect and mitigate bias,
        e.g., [synthetic data generation](/technical-tools/sdg/) and [bias
        detection tool](/technical-tools/bdt/).
