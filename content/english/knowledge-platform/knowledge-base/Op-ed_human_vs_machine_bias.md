  Based on bias testing results from the Municipality of Amsterdam, it is argued
  that that algorithms can play an important role in mitigating biases
  originating from humans

Op-ed, as <a href="https://www.parool.nl/columns-opinie/opinie-onderzoek-vooringenomenheid-van-zowel-algoritme-als-ambtenaar~bd69aa5e/" target="_blank">published</a> in Parool on 14-02-2024, arguing that:

* Not only algorithmic-driven processes can have discriminatory effects, but that human-driven process can be severely biased too;
* They argue therefore that, as a result of the performed bias test by the City of Amsterdam, not only should the explainable boosting ML-model be abandoned, but also the allegedly detected human biases within the processes of the City of Amsterdam should be subject to further investigation;
* Because more open and transparent research is needed to strengthen human-machine interplay to prevent systemic biases in the digital future.
