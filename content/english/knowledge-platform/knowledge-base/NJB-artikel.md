###### **Abstract**

By means of two case positions regarding the use of machine learning-driven risk profiling by the municipalities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the concept of 'algoprudence' is introduced and explained. This new term refers to concrete, case-based, and decentralized judgments regarding the normative decision made to design and deploy algorithms. The article illustrates that the general principles of sound administration (as specified in Dutch Administrative Law) are insufficient to provide concrete standards for these algorithms, the authors argue that algoprudence can serve as a useful addition to and concretization of existing legal frameworks.
