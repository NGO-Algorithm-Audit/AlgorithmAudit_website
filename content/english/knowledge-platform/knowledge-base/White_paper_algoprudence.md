At a high-level this article follows the structure of the original [article](/nl/knowledge-platform/knowledge-base/white_paper_algoprudence/) in Dutch *How ‘algoprudence’ can contribute to responsible use of ML-algorithms*

###### Abstract

By means of two case positions regarding the use of machine learning-driven risk profiling by the municipalities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the concept of ‘algoprudence’ is introduced and explained. This new term refers to concrete, case-based, and decentralized judgments regarding the normative decision made to design and deploy algorithms. The article illustrates that the general principles from various legal frameworks, such as EU non-discrimination law, the GDPR, AI Act and Dutch Administrative Law, are insufficient to provide concrete standards for these algorithms, it is argued that algoprudence can serve as a useful addition to and concretization of existing legal frameworks.
