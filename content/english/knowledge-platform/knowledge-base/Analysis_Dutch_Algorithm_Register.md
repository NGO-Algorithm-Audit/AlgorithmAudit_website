#### Algorithm Register: from pinnacle of transparency to puzzle of paperwork 

More than 1.245 algorithms have already been published by 289 organisations in the Dutch Algorithm Register. But how informative is the information that’s currently provided? 

We analysed the current state of the Algorithm Register. The key takeaways are explained in the carousel below ⬇️ 

We identify three solutions to strengthen trust in Dutch government algorithms by improving the type and quality of registered information: 

1. **Develop vertical standards:** Develop technology-specific requirements – such as accuracy specifications for facial recognition software – that can be requested during procurement and can be published in the Algorithm Register.

2. **Make some categories mandatory for publication:** Require high-risk AI systems and highimpact algorithms to publish, at least, their legal basis and an identification of
risks.

3. **Develop national guidelines for complete and consistent classification:** National guidelines are needed to ensure accurate and consistent identification and risk classification across organisations.
