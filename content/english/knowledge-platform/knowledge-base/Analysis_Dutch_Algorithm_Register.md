#### Analysis Dutch Algorithm Register

Algorithm Register: from pinnacle of transparency to puzzle of paperwork 

More than 1.245 algorithms have already been published by 289 organisations in the Dutch Algorithm Register. But how informative is the information that’s currently provided? 

We analysed the current state of the Algorithm Register. The key takeaways are explained in the carousel below ⬇️ 

We identify three solutions to strengthen trust in Dutch government algorithms by improving the type and quality of registered information: 

1. Develop vertical standards 

2. Make some categories mandatory for publication 

3. Develop national guidelines for complete and consistent classification 

👩🏼‍💻 The code for the analysis can be found open source in [Github](https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/Algorithm-Register-Analysis).
