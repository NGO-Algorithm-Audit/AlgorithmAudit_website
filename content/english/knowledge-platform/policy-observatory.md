        AI ethics urgently needs case-based experience and a bottom-up approach.
        We believe existing and proposed legislation is and will not suffice to
        realize ethical algorithms. Why not?
      ai_act_title: AI Act
      ai_act_content: >-
        The <a

        target="_blank">AI Act </a> imposes broad new responsibilities to
        control risks from AI systems without at the same time laying down
        specific standards they are expected to meet. For instance<span>:</span>
      ai_act_tag_conformity: 'Conformity assessment (Art. 43)<span>:</span>'
      ai_act_content_conformity: >-
        The proposed route for internal control relies too much on the
        self-reflective capacities of producers to assess AI quality management,
        risk management and bias. Resulting in subjective best-practices;
      ai_act_tag_risk: 'Risk- and quality management systems (Art. 9 and 17)<span>:</span>'
      ai_act_content_risk: >-
        Requirements set out for risk management systems and quality management
        systems remain too generic. For example, it does not provide precise
        guidelines how to identify and mitigate ethical issues such as
        algorithmic discrimination;
      ai_act_tag_standards: 'Normative standards<span>:</span>'
      ai_act_content_standards: >-
        To realize AI harmonization across the EU, publicly available technical
        and normative best-practices for fair AI are urgently needed.

        target="_blank">DSA</a> lacks provisions to disclose normative

        target="_blank">Delegated Regulation (DR)</a> for independent third
        party auditing (as mandated under DSA Art. 37) specifies that “audit
        risk analysis shall consider _inherent risk_, _control risk_ and
        _detection risk_”. More specific guidance should be provided in Art. 2
        of the DR how risks relating to subjective concepts, such as “...the
        nature, the activity and the use of the audited service”, can be
        assessed;

        Pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of the DR, Very Large Open Platforms (VLOPs)
        and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) shall transmit to
        third-party auditing organisations “benchmarks used [...] to assert or
        monitor compliance [...], as well as supporting documentation”. We argue
        that the normative considerations underlying the selection of these
        benchmarks should be asked out more decisively in this phase of the
        audit. Therefore, we asked the European Commission (EC) to add this
        dimension to Question 3(a) of Section D.1 _Audit conclusion for
        obligation Subsection_ II. _Audit procedures and their results_;

      gdpr_title: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      gdpr_content1: >-
        Organizations that develop algorithms do often not comply with GDPR
        provisions that foster participatory algorithm development. For
        example<span>:</span>
      gdpr_content2: >-
        Besides, the current regulation only partially specifies measures to
        safeguard algorithmic decision-making. For instance<span>:</span>
      gdpr_tag_dpia: 'Participatroy DPIA (art. 35 sub 9)<span>:</span>'
      gdpr_content_dpia: >-
        This provision mandates that in cases where a Data Privacy Impact
        Assessment (DPIA) is obligatory, the opinions of data subjects regarding
        the planned data processing shall be seeked. This is a powerful legal
        mechanism to foster collaborative algorithm development. Nevertheless,
        the inclusion of data subjects in this manner is scarcely observed in
        practice;
      gdpr_tag_profiling: Profiling (recital 71)
      gdpr_content_profiling: >-
        is broadly defined as<span>:</span> “to analyse or predict aspects
        concerning the data subject’s performance at work, economic situation,
        health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour,
        location or movements”. However, the approval of profiling, particularly
        when “authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is
        subject, including fraud monitoring”, grants public and private entities
        significant flexibility to integrate algorithmic decision-making derived
        from diverse types of profiling. This wide latitude raises concerns
        about the potential for excessive consolidation of personal data and the
        consequences of algorithmic determinations;
      gdpr_tag_ADM: 'Automated decision-making (art. 22 sub 2)<span>:</span>'
      gdpr_content_ADM: >-
        Allowing wide-ranging automated decision-making (ADM) and profiling
        under the sole condition of contract agreement opens the door for large
        scale unethical algorithmic practices without accountability and public
        awareness.

      administrative_law_title: Administrative law
      administrative_law_content: >-
        Unifying principles of sound administration with (semi-) automated
        decision-making is challenging. For instance<span>:</span>
      administrative_law_tag_motivation: 'Obligation to state reasons:</span>'
      administrative_law_content_motivation: >-
        Governmental institutions must always provide clear explanations for
        their decisions. However, when machine learning is employed, such as in
        variable selection for risk profiling, this transparency may be
        obscured. This leads to the question of how far arguments based on
        probability distributions are acceptable as explanations for why certain
        citizens are chosen for a particular profile.

        target="_blank">Perspective 3.1.1</a> in the Guidelines for Algorithms
        of the Dutch Court of Auditors argues that ethical algorithms are not
        allowed to “discriminate and that bias should be minimised”. Missing
        from this judgment is a discussion of what precisely constitutes bias in
        the context of algorithms and what would be appropriate methods to
        ascertain and mitigate algorithmic discrimination. In the absence of a
        clear ethical framework, it is up to organizations to formulate
        context-sensitive approaches to combat discrimination.

        the Dutch government, assess discriminatory practice mainly by asking
        questions that are meant to stimulate self-reflection. It does not
        provide answers or concrete guidelines how to realise ethical
        algorithms.

        We believe a case-based and context sensitive approach is indispensable
        to develop ethical algorithms. One should not expect top-down regulation
        and legislation to solve all ethical problems in AI and machine
        learning. Taking all contested algorithmic cases to court is practically
        infeasible. More importantly, organizations will always carry their own
        responsibility for ethical algorithms within and beyond the obligation
        of legal compliance. Hence, new bottom-up initiatives like Algorithm
        Audit are necessary to support these organizations and to strengthen
        ethical practice in ADM and decision support.


        We provide a platform where experts in AI ethics from various
        disciplines can interact with, learn from and steer actual algorithmic
        practice and surrounding ethical concerns. We increase public knowledge
        and stimulate an informed and open debate about what ethical algorithms
        we desire as a society in various contexts. Our audit commissions shape
        future public values through discussion and deliberation. As such,
        Algorithm Audit contributes in the digital realm to SDG16 – Peace,
        Justice and Strong Institutions.
