Over the course of 2023-24, Algorithm Audit has paired up with Dutch public sector organisation DUO to build algorithm validation capacity from both a qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The organisation have been working on:

* a technical review of the control process for college loan allowances, of which the result was sent to the Dutch parliament;
* collaboratively submitted a request to the Dutch National Office of Statistics in order to conduct a large-scale study on proxy characteristics;
* finding solutions to deal with the normative dimension of auditing and evaluating algorithmic-driven decision-making processes, for instance involvement of various stakeholders to qualitatively interpret quantitative measurements.
