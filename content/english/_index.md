  title: Case-based advice for ethical algorithms
  image: images/banner2.png
  content: Algorithm Audit is a non-profit foundation that increases public knowledge
    of algorithmic ethics. We believe in a bottom-up approach to algorithmic ethics
    that starts from concrete case-based experience. We form independent audit commissions
    that give ethical advice on concrete cases from industry and the public sector.
    By making the reports publicly available, we contribute to the knowledge and experience
    in algorithmic ethics of experts, policy makers and the wider public.

  feature_item:
  - name: Auditing algorithms
    icon: fas fa-search
    content: We review algorithmic decision and prediction models, the data that is
      used and the larger processes in which they are involved. We believe a balanced
      ethical judgment of algorithmic processes must be context-sensitive and mindful
      of the real societal impact.
  - name: Independent
    icon: fas fa-star-of-life
    content: Our audit commissions are made up of independent, academic experts with
      no ties to the involved industry or organization. We work together with partners
      on explicit conditions of autonomy and transparency. We do not cooperate in
      ethics washing.
  - name: Nonprofit
    icon: fas fa-leaf
    content: We are a foundation that works nonprofit for building public knowledge.
      We are supported by independent public funding and our case-specific expenses
      are covered by partners under explicit conditions that guarantee autonomous
      evaluation by our commissions.

      Industry players and government institutions, big or small. Similar ethical
      concerns arise in both private and public use of algorithms, and we believe
