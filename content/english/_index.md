    Who decides on the algorithms that shape our daily lives? We believe this
    belongs to all of us. Our team of data scientists, lawyers, and ethicists
    tackles value-based questions at the heart of AI. As a knowledge platform,
    we bridge the gap between policy initiatives, academic insights and
    case-based experience. Through open-source tools, independent validation and
    advice, we translate knowledge into action. Connect with us to make
    responsible AI a shared effort.
