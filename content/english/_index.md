  content: Algorithm Audit is a nonprofit organization that builds and shares knowledge
    of ethical algorithms. We believe in a bottom-up approach. Thatâ€™s why we start
    from concrete case-based experience. We form independent audit commissions to
    give advice on ethical issues that arise in industry and the public sector. By
    making advisory reports publicly available, we foster collective knowledge and
    experience in the ethics of algorithmic systems, serving the international community
    of experts, policy makers and the wider public.

  feature_item:
  - name: Auditing algorithms
    icon: fas fa-search
    content: We review algorithmic decision and prediction models, the data used and
      the processes in which they are involved. We believe a balanced ethical judgment
      of algorithmic processes must be context-sensitive and mindful of its societal
      impact.
  - name: Independent
    icon: fas fa-star-of-life
    content: Our audit commissions are independent, academic, multi-disciplinary and
      diverse. Participating experts have no ties to the algorithmic methods or organizations
      under review. We work together with partners under explicit conditions to avoid
      ethics washing.
  - name: Nonprofit
    icon: fas fa-leaf
    content: We are a nonprofit organization supported by independent public funding.
      Occasionally, case-specific expenses are covered by partners under conditions
      that guarantee independent evaluation by our audit commissions and transparant
      publication of results.
  - name: Public knowledge
    icon: fab fa-slideshare
    content: All our cases and corresponding advice are made publicly available on
      this website, increasing public knowledge how to devise and use algorithms in
      an ethical way. We interact with international experts, policy makers and the
      wider public to foster circulation of knowledge.
  - name: Techno-ethical jurisprudence
    icon: fas fa-book-reader
    content: From our case-based knowledge developers and data scientists can distill
      best practices to develop ethical algorithms. We hope a helpful resource for
      techno-ethical issues emerges over time.
  - name: Partners
    icon: fas fa-hands-helping
    content: We review concrete ethical issues that emerge in algorithmic methods
      used by public and private organizations. Because similar ethical concerns arise
      in disparate organizations, we are devoted to removing boundaries to approach
      ethical algorithms ethics collectively.
