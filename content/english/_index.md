    content: We work together with international experts from various backgrounds,
      e.g. ethicists, legal professionals, data scientists. The composition of audit
      commissions varies per case. Most of the experts are affiliated with academic
      institutions. The Algorithm Audit team facilitates the procurement of sufficient
      background information about the case, after which the experts conduct an in-depth
      study, first individually and then collectively. Our team drafts a report that
      condenses the varied views of the commission.The report published by Algorithm
      Audit has been agreed upon by the commission members.

    # intro
    intro_content: AI ethics urgently needs case-based experience and a bottom-up approach. We believe existing and proposed legislation is and will not suffice to realize ethical algorithms. Why not? 
    
    #AI Act
    ai_act_content:  The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623335154975&uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206" target="_blank">AI Act </a> imposes broad new responsibilities to control risks from AI systems without at the same time laying down specific standards they are expected to meet. For instance<a>:</a>
    ai_act_tag_conformity: Conformity assessment (Art. 43)<a>:</a>
    ai_act_content_conformity: The proposed route for internal control relies too much on the self-reflective capacities of producers to assess AI quality management, risk management and bias. Resulting in subjective best-practices;
    ai_act_tag_risk: Risk- and quality management systems (Art. 9 and 17)<a>:</a>
    ai_act_content_risk: Requirements set out for risk management systems and quality management systems remain too generic. For example, it does not provide precise guidelines how to identify and mitigate ethical issues such as algorithmic discrimination;
    ai_act_tag_standards: Normative standards<a>:</a>
    ai_act_content_standards: To realize AI harmonization across the EU, publicly available technical and normative best-practices for fair AI are urgently needed.

    #DSA
    dsa_content: The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0825" target="_blank">Digital Services Act (DSA) </a> lacks provisions to disclose normative methodological choices that underlie general purpose AI systems. For instance<a>:</a>
    dsa_tag_risk: Risk definitions<a>:</a>
    dsa_content_risk: Article 9 of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13626-Digital-Services-Act-conducting-independent-audits_en" target="_blank">Delegated Regulation (DR)</a> for independent third party auditing (as mandated under DSA Art. 37) specifies that “audit risk analysis shall consider _inherent risk_, _control risk_ and _detection risk_”. More specific guidance should be provided in Art. 2 of the DR how risks relating to subjective concepts, such as “...the nature, the activity and the use of the audited service”, can be assessed;  
    dsa_tag_template: Audit template<a>:</a>
    dsa_content_template: Pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of the DR, Very Large Open Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) shall transmit to third-party auditing organisations “benchmarks used [...] to assert or monitor compliance [...], as well as supporting documentation”. We argue that the normative considerations underlying the selection of these benchmarks should be asked out more decisively in this phase of the audit. Therefore, we asked the European Commission (EC) to add this dimension to Question 3(a) of Section D.1 _Audit conclusion for obligation Subsection_ II. _Audit procedures and their results_;

    dsa_content_feedback_tab1: Private auditors (like PwC and Deloitte) warn that the lack of guidance on criteria against which to audit poses a risk of subjective audits;
    dsa_content_feedback_tab2: Tech companies (like Snap and Wikipedia) raise concerns about the industry's lack of expertise to audit specific AI products, like company-tailored timeline recommender systems.

    #GDPR
    gdpr_content1: Conditions provided in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 22(2)</a>
      under which automated decision-making (ADM) and profiling is allowed are open
      for broad interpretation. Allowing wide-ranging ADM under the sole condition
      of contract agreement opens the door for large scale unethical algorithmic practices
      without accountability and public awareness.
    gdpr_content2: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 35(9)</a>
      stimulates controller to seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.

    #Regulators
    regulator_content: <a href="https://www.rekenkamer.nl/onderwerpen/algoritmes-digitaal-toetsingskader/ethiek" target="_blank">Perspective 3.1.1</a> in the Guidelines for Algorithms of the Dutch Court of Auditors argues that
      ethical algorithms are not allowed to “discriminate and that bias should be
      minimised”. Missing from this judgment is a discussion of what precisely constitutes
      bias in the context of algorithms and what would be appropriate methods to ascertain
      and mitigate algorithmic discrimination. In the absence of a clear ethical framework, it
      is up to organizations to formulate context-sensitive approaches to combat discrimination.

      It does not provide answers or concrete guidelines how to realise ethical algorithms.
    hria_image: images/FRIA.png
    content1:  We believe a case-based and context sensitive approach is indispensable to develop ethical algorithms. One should not expect top-down regulation and
      legislation to solve all ethical problems in AI and machine learning. Taking
      all contested algorithmic cases to court is practically infeasible. More importantly,
      organizations will always carry their own responsibility for ethical algorithms
      within and beyond the obligation of legal compliance. Hence, new bottom-up initiatives
      like Algorithm Audit are necessary to support these organizations and to strengthen
      ethical practice in ADM and decision support.
      

      We provide a platform where experts
      in AI ethics from various disciplines can interact with, learn from and steer actual algorithmic practice
      and surrounding ethical concerns. We increase public knowledge and stimulate
      an informed and open debate about what ethical algorithms we desire as a society in various
      contexts. Our audit commissions shape future public values through discussion and deliberation. As such, Algorithm Audit contributes in the digital realm to SDG16 – Peace, Justice and
      Strong Institutions.
