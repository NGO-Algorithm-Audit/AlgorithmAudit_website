  content: Algorithm Audit is a nonprofit organization that builds and shares knowledge
    of ethical algorithms. We believe in a bottom-up approach. Thatâ€™s why we start
    from concrete case-based experience. We form independent audit commissions to
    give advice on ethical issues that arise in industry and the public sector. By
    making advisory reports publicly available, we foster collective knowledge and
    experience in the ethics of algorithmic systems, serving the international community
    of experts, policy makers and the wider public.

  - name: Auditing algorithms
    icon: fas fa-search
    content: We review algorithmic decision and prediction models, the data used and
      the processes in which they are involved. We believe a balanced ethical judgment
      of algorithmic processes must be context-sensitive and mindful of its societal
      impact.
  - name: Independent
    icon: fas fa-star-of-life
    content: Our audit commissions are independent, academic, multi-disciplinary and
      diverse. Participating experts have no ties to the algorithmic methods or organizations
      under review. We work together with partners under explicit conditions to avoid
      ethics washing.

      We are supported by independent public funding and our case-specific expenses
      are covered by partners under explicit conditions that guarantee autonomous
