        Algoprudence (AA:2023:02) Risk Profiling for Social Welfare
        Reexamination 
      intro: >
        The commission judges that algorithmic risk profiling can be used under
        strict conditions for sampling residents receiving social welfare for
        re-examination. The aim of re-examination is a leading factor in judging
        profiling criteria.
