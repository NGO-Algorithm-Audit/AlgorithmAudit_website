        Algoprudence (AA:2023:02) Risk Profiling for Social Welfare
        Reexamination 
      intro: >
        The advice commission judges that algorithmic risk profiling can be used
        under strict conditions for sampling residents receiving social welfare
        for re-examination. The aim of re-examination is a leading factor in
        judging profiling criteria.
