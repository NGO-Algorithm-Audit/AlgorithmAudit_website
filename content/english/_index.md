    content: We work together with international experts from various backgrounds,
      e.g. ethicists, legal professionals, data scientists. The composition of audit
      commissions varies per case. Most of the experts are affiliated with academic
      institutions. The Algorithm Audit team facilitates the procurement of sufficient
      background information about the case, after which the experts conduct an in-depth
      study, first individually and then collectively. Our team drafts a report that
      condenses the varied views of the commission.The report published by Algorithm
      Audit has been agreed upon by the commission members.

  - title: Why we exist
    intro_content: Algorithm Audit was founded on the idea that ethics in algorithmic methods
      urgently needs case-based experience and a bottom-up approach. We believe existing
      and proposed legislation is and will not suffice to realize ethical algorithms.
      Why not? 
    gdpr_content: The conditions given in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/" target="_blank">GDPR Article 22 (2)</a>
      under which automated decision-making (ADM) and profiling is allowed are open
      for broad interpretation. Allowing wide-ranging ADM under the sole condition
      of contract agreement opens the door for large scale unethical algorithmic practices
      without accountability and public awareness.

    ai_act_content:  The newly proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623335154975&uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206" target="_blank">AI Act </a> of the European Commission
      aims to regulate the use of high-risk algorithms, but remains too generic. For
      example, it does not provide precise guidelines how to identify and mitigate
      ethical issues such as algorithmic discrimination. In addition, machine learning
      practice that falls outside the high-risk category is not exempt from major
      ethical concerns. The legal measures, which only become effective in several
      years, will become a playground for legal experts and lawyers and will not directly
      offer concrete and extensive guidelines on ethical algorithms for organizations
      in industry and government. Hence, organizations will still need to make up
      their own mind about context-specific ethical guidelines and procedures in their
      use of algorithmic methods.

    rekenkamer_content: <a href="https://www.rekenkamer.nl/onderwerpen/algoritmes-digitaal-toetsingskader/ethiek" target="_blank">Perspective 3.1.1</a> in the Guidelines for Algorithms of the Dutch Court of Auditors argues that
      ethical algorithms are not allowed to “discriminate and that bias should be
      minimised”. Missing from this judgment is a discussion of what precisely constitutes
      bias in the context of algorithms and what would be appropriate methods to ascertain
      and mitigate algorithmic discrimination. In the absence of a clear ethical framework, it
      is up to organizations to formulate context-sensitive approaches to combat discrimination.

      Non-Discrimination</a>, both developed by the Dutch government, assess discriminatory
      practice mainly by asking questions that are meant to stimulate self-reflection.
      It does not provide answers or concrete guidelines how to realise ethical algorithms.
    content1:  We believe a case-based and context sensitive approach is indispensable to develop ethical algorithms. One should not expect top-down regulation and
      legislation to solve all ethical problems in AI and machine learning. Taking
      all contested algorithmic cases to court is practically infeasible. More importantly,
      organizations will always carry their own responsibility for ethical algorithms
      within and beyond the obligation of legal compliance. Hence, new bottom-up initiatives
      like Algorithm Audit are necessary to support these organizations and to strengthen
      ethical practice in ADM and decision support.
      

      We provide a platform where experts
      in AI ethics from various disciplines can interact with, learn from and steer actual algorithmic practice
      and surrounding ethical concerns. We increase public knowledge and stimulate
      an informed and open debate about what ethical algorithms we desire as a society in various
      contexts. Our audit commissions shape future public values through discussion and deliberation. As such, Algorithm Audit contributes in the digital realm to SDG16 – Peace, Justice and
      Strong Institutions.
