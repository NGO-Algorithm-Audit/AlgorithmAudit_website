      Presentation Validation framework 'Responsible use of Large Language Models (LLM) for public information provision' (Dutch only)
    description: >
     This presentation accompanied the launch of our validation framework <a href="https://algorithmaudit.eu/technical-tools/eval-gen-ai/" target="_blank">'Responsible use of Large Language Models (LLM) for public information provision'</a>. The tool was created in collaboration with the Council for the Judiciary, Eindhoven University of Technology, T&T Data Consultancy and Deloitte, and made possible by co-financing from the <a href="https://www.sidnfonds.nl/themed-call-responsible-ai-in-practice" target="_blank">'Responsible AI in practice'</a> call. The event facilitated broad discussion about using LLM's in public information provision through panel discussions and also featured speakers SIDN and the EU AI Office.

      Course on 'GPAI validation framework', Dutch Academy for Legislation
    description: >
      This course by the <a href="https://www.academievoorwetgeving.nl/" target="_blank">Academy for Legislation</a> introduced participants to a validation framework for GenAI compliance with the GDPR, AI Act, and Awb. This framework is based on the award-winning pilot <a href="https://www.voorrecht-rechtspraak.nl/?gad_campaignid=20543704506&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAqISXNk5lT50oQXLDxbh9WnFhs2tS&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sKPh6yRjgMVZJGDBx0nJRHJEAAYASAAEgKdX_D_BwE" target="_blank">voorRecht-Rechtspraak</a>, in which LLMs are leveraged to support citizens in disputes around construction and housing law. The course touched on the usefulness of text filters for data protection, how to ensure reliability when synthesizing text, link between the AI Act and Awb, as well making chatbot interactions responsible and citizen-friendly.

      How do the opportunities of complex, data-driven models relate to their
      limitations and political sensitivities, and what realistic demands can we
      make regarding the standardization and transparency of their scientific
      and democratic legitimacy?

      Topics discussed: \* What (theoretical) frameworks and instruments we see
      available for validating, verifying, and ensuring transparency when
      governments deploy models (and algorithms)?


      * What (theoretical) “menu” these paint for governments to choose from

      * What prospects we see for governments to communicate openly about their
      use of models in a consistent and auditable way?

    description: >
      In 2024-25, Algorithm Audit collaborated with the Dutch Ministry of the
      Interior and the Dutch Executive Agency for Education (DUO) to develop and
      test tools designed to validate algorithmic systems. Two open-source tools
      were launched on June 10th 12-13h (in Dutch) and June 13th 12-13h (in
      English). Topics discussed:


      1. [Unsupervised bias detection tool](/technical-tools/bdt/#web-app): How
      to detect bias if no demographic data is available?

      2. [Synthetic data generation](/technical-tools/sdg/#web-app): How can
      third parties evaluate dataset representativeness without personal data
      being shared?


      The tools developed provide answers for these questions. The tools are
      built following a local-only architecture, meaning that data are processed
      by your own device without being uploaded to external (commercial)
      platforms or cloud providers.

      van Egmond (Dutch DPA), Carlos Mougan (Europe’s AI Office), Prof Brent
      Mittelstadt (Oxford Internet Institute) and Ylja Remmits (Algorithm
      Audit).


      * To what extent should a state collect sensitive data attributes, such as
      ethnicity and race, about its inhabitants?

      * Why do quantitative insights relating to the proxy nature of profiling
      characteristics matter?

      * What hinders the widespread adoption of empirical methods for testing
      bias in algorithmic systems?

      * Does bias testing inevitably lead to the feared ‘battle of numbers’, or
      could it play a crucial role for establishing meaningful democratic
      oversight of AI?

      case: indirect discrimination through risk profiling.*


      Points of discussion were:


      * Unique analysis based on CBS data

      * Analysis of migration background of 300,000+ students

      * Seemingly neutral algorithms can have discriminatory consequences

      * Preventing indirect discrimination in organizations

      SPUI25: The Meta Case - challenging discriminatory algorithms through

    description: >
      Panel discussion on The Meta Case with Jurriaan Parie (Algorithm Audit),
      Rosie Sharpe (Global Witness), Naomi Appelman (PhD Institute for
      Information Law at the University of Amsterdam and co-founder Racism and
      Technology Center) and Berty Bannor (Bureau Clara Wichmann).


      The panelists discussed whether Facebook is potentially violating Dutch
      equality laws. The origins of this Meta Case was elaborated upon,
      especially regarding how technological developments can reflect, identify,
      and address societal issues such as sexism, racism, and other types of
      discrimination.

      Technologies, University Leiden).


      * From the perspective of both individual and institutional legal
      protection, what are the implications of decentralizing decisions
      regarding fundamental rights, and what issues might it resolve or
      introduce?

      * How can normative disputes be settled when performing Fundamental Rights
      Impact Assessments (FRIAs) in AI development?

      * What is the role of regulatory bodies in providing guidance for
      resolving normative challenges regarding AI fairness?

      * What is “algoprudence” and how can it contribute to more fair AI
      decisions?

      Algorithm Audit hosted a public seminar on algorithm validation and
      algoprudence in The Hague. Anne Meuwese shared insights on the value of
      algoprudence in contextualizing legal norms. Floris Holstege shed light
      into statistical hypothesis testing which plays an important role in our
      recent techincal audits. We appreciated the interactive Q\&A with the
      participants, especially the curious and critical questions which enables
      us to clarify our work, but also contributes to the further development
      and refinement of our activities as an NGO.
