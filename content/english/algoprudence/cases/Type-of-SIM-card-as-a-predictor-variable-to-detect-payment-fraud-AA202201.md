summary: >
  The commission advises against using type of SIM card as an input variable in
  algorithmic models that predict payment defaults and block afterpay services
  for specific customers. As it is likely that type of SIM card acts as a
  proxy-variable for sensitive demographic categories, the model would run an
  intolerable risk of disproportionally excluding vulnerable demographic groups
  from the payment service. Absent reliable data that demonstrates otherwise,
  the ethical risk of including the SIM card variable outweighs potential
  benefits. The commission advises to consider a variety of alternatives in
  dealing with payment defaults.
