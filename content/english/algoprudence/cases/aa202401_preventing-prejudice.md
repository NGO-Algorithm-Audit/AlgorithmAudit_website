#### Algoprudence idetification code

TA:AA:2024:01

#### Summary

In the period 2012-2022,  students who lived close to their parent(s) have been selected significantly more often by Dutch public sector organisation DUO than other students. The algorithm used to support the selection procedure performed as expected. The combination of the algorithm-driven risk scoring and manual selection for the contorl process resulted in a significant overrepresentation of certain groups. Selected students were visited at home to verify whether they were not misusing college allowances. This is the main conclusion of the audit conducted by the Algorithm Audit Foundation on behalf of DUO. DUO's control process came under scrutiny in 2023 following <a href="https://nos.nl/op3/video/2479701-zo-checkt-duo-of-jij-fraudeert-en-dat-systeem-rammelt" target="_blank">news items</a> from Investico and NOS, which stated that students with a migration background were more often accused of abuse than other students.
