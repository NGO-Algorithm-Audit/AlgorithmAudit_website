  The commission judges that algorithmic risk profiling can be used under strict
  conditions for sampling residents receiving social welfare for re-examination.
  The aim of re-examination is a leading factor in judging profiling criteria.

key_takeaways:
  - title: Algorithmic profiling is possible under strict conditions
    content: >
      The use of algorithmic profiling to re-examine whether social welfare
      benefits have been duly granted, is acceptable if applied responsibly.
  - title: Profiling must not equate suspicion
    content: |
      Re-examination needs to be based more on service and less on distrust.
  - title: Diversity in selection methods
    content: >
      To avoid tunnel vision and negative feedback loops, algorithmic profiling
      ought to be combined with expert-driven profiling and random sampling.
  - title: Well-considered use of profiling criteria
    content: >
      Caring to avoid (proxy) discrimination and other undesirable forms of
      differentiation, the normative advice commission assessed variables
      individually on their eligibility for profiling (see Infographic).
  - title: Explainability requirements for machine learning
    content: >
      It is necessary that the sampling of residents can be explained throughout
      the entire decision-making process. Complex training methods for variable
      selection, such as the xgboost algorithm discussed in this case study, are
      considered too complex to meet explainability requirements.
summary: >
  The commission judges that algorithmic risk profiling can be used under strict
  conditions for sampling residents receiving social welfare for re-examination.
  The aim of re-examination is a leading factor in judging profiling criteria.
  If re-examination were based less on distrust and adopts a more
  service-oriented approach, then the advice commission judges a broader use of
  profiling variables permissible to enable more precise targeting of
  individuals in need of assistance. For various variables used by the
  Municipality of Rotterdam during the period 2017-2021, the commission gives an
  argued judgement why these variables are or are not eligible as a profiling
  selection criterion (see Infographic). A combined use of several sampling
  methods (including expert-driven profiling and random sampling) is recommended
  to avoid tunnel vision and negative feedback loops. The commission advises
  stricter conditions for the selection of variables for use by algorithms than
  for selection by domain experts. The commission states that algorithms used to
  sample citizens for re-examination must be explainable. Complex training
  methods, such as the xgboost model used by the Municipality of Rotterdam, do
  not meet this explainability criterion. This advice is directed towards all
  Dutch and European municipalities that use or consider using profiling methods
  in the context of social services.

      whether the machine learning (ML)-driven risk profiling algorithm
      currently tested by the City of Amsterdam satisfies the requirements as
      set out in AA-2023:02:A, including:


      * (in)eligible selection criteria fed to the ML model

      * explainability requirements for the used explainable boosting algorithm

      * implications of the AIAct for this particular form of risk profiling.
