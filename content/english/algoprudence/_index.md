title: Algoprudence
subtitle: We are working on a variety of cases. Once an normative advice commission has gathered and examined the ethical issue, the original problem statement and corresponding advice will be published on this website. Others learn from our algoprudence, help to improve it and utilize it as a best practice in similar cases.


  We are open to new cases. Please [<span style="color:#005aa7"> reach out</span>](/#contactform) to us when you know a case for review.

<!-- Case Rotterdam -->
{{< case_Rotterdam "Risk Profiling for Social Welfare Reexamination" "The composition of the audit commission for this case is made publicly available once the final advice of the commission is published.">}} This project sheds light on the complex tension between fairness, non-discrimination and statistics in risk assessment tools. Which characteristics of citizens and customers should be considered as protected variables and proxies for protected variables? To what extent and under what circumstances should these (proxy)variables be included or excluded from algorithmic predictions?

We are working with academic partners on an advice regarding the above-mentioned ethical issue that emerged at the Municipality of Rotterdam. For this project we are supported by the <a href="https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten/ethical-risk-assessment-tool" target="_blank">SIDN Fund</a>.
