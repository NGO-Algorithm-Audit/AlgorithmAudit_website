  We are working on a variety of cases. Once an normative advice commission has
  gathered and examined the ethical issue, the original problem statement and
  corresponding advice will be published on this website. Others learn from our
  algoprudence, help to improve it and utilize it as a best practice in similar
  cases.


  We are open to new cases. Please [<span style="color:#005aa7"> reach
  out</span>](/#contactform) to us when you know a case for review.

  - title: 'Risk Profiling for Social Welfare Reexamination (AA:2023:02)'
    intro: >-
      The commission judges that algorithmic risk profiling can be used under
      strict conditions for sampling residents receiving social welfare for
      re-examination. The aim of re-examination is a leading factor in judging
      profiling criteria.

  - title: 'BERT-based disinformation classifier (AA:2023:01)'
    intro: >-
      The audit commission believes there is a low risk of (higher-dimensional)
      proxy discrimination by the BERT-based disinformation classifier and that
      the particular difference in treatment identified by the quantitative bias
      scan can be justified, if certain conditions apply.

      Type of SIM card as a predictor variable to detect payment fraud
      (AA:2022:01)
    intro: >-
      The audit commission advises against using type of SIM card as an input
      variable in algorithmic models that predict payment defaults and block
      afterpay services for specific customers. As it is likely that type of SIM
      card acts as a proxy-variable for sensitive demographic categories, the
      model would run an intolerable risk of disproportionally excluding
      vulnerable demographic groups from the payment service.
