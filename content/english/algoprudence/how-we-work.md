#### Step 1 – Identifying an issue

Identifying a concrete ethical issue in a real algorithm or data-analysis tool

#### Step 2 – Problem statement

Description of ethical issue, legal aspects, statistical methodology and hearing stakeholders and affected groups

#### Step 3 – Advice commission

Deliberative conversation on ethical issue by diverse and inclusive advice commission

#### Step 4 – Public advice

Advice of commission is [published](/algoprudence/case-repository/) together with problem statement on our website. Publicly sharing the problem statement and normative advice is called _algoprudence_.
