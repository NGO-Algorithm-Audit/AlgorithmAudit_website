title: 'Type of SIM card as a predictor variable to detect payment fraud (AA:2022:01)'
icon: fa-sim-card
summary: >
  The audit commission advises against using type of SIM card as an input
  variable in algorithmic models that predict payment defaults and block
  afterpay services for specific customers. As it is likely that type of SIM
  card acts as a proxy-variable for sensitive demographic categories, the model
  would run an intolerable risk of disproportionally excluding vulnerable
  demographic groups from the payment service. Absent reliable data that
  demonstrates otherwise, the ethical risk of including the SIM card variable
  outweighs potential benefits. The commission advises to consider a variety of
  alternatives in dealing with payment defaults.
